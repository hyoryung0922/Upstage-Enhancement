Monitoring the integrative complexity of American and Soviet policy', 'Introduction\\nKarl Jaspers introduced ideas relevant to collusion in his seminal work General Psychopathology (Allgemeine Psychopathologie), first published in 1913. However, Jaspers did not use the term \"collusion\" explicitly in the way it is commonly understood today. Instead, his work laid the groundwork for understanding interpersonal dynamics and the therapist\\'s influence on the therapeutic relationship.\\nThe term \"collusion\" in psychotherapy was first introduced by Sándor Ferenczi in 1933. He described collusion as an unconscious process linking the transference reactions of the patient with the countertransference reactions of clinicians, leading to specific and often complex dynamics in the therapeutic relationship.', 'Oral collusion\\nIn the oral collusion one partner takes the role of the caretaker and one partner takes the role of the fosterling. Because the couple is committed to their roles, the conflict develops, where the caretaker perceives the fosterling to be insatiable and ungrateful and the caretaker is perceived accusing and dismissive by the fosterling. The fosterling often reacts depressive. Basically, both partners agree, that the meaning of love is to take care of each other. Their joint resistance, the common fear directs against the idea, that the fosterling must take nursing tasks towards the caretaker. Counseling can help the couple to practice their roles and to reflect experiences and resistances.', \"The concept of collusion in couples' relations with two partners is a psychological term for behavioral patterns in relationships for couples therapy. In contemporary psychotherapeutical practice, collusion often refers to a failure of the therapist to maintain neutrality or objectivity, such as when the therapist aligns too closely with a client's distorted perspectives or defenses. It highlights the importance of self-awareness and reflective practice for the therapist.\"]\n",

      "The context does not provide specific information about the ethical responsibility of a psychologist in meeting with a 10-year-old child for counseling in a school setting. However, based on the general principles of ethics in psychology, the best way for the psychologist to meet the prescribed ethical responsibility would be to obtain both written consent from the parent(s) and verbal assent from the child. This is because the child may not fully understand the implications of therapy and may not be able to provide informed consent. Therefore, the psychologist should ensure that the parent(s) understand the nature of the therapy and provide written consent, while also obtaining the child's assent verbally to ensure that the child is willing to participate in the therapy.\n",

List 49, Misc. 2d 300 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1966)\\nFacts: Erna Menzel and her husband fled Belgium in 1940 during the German invasion, leaving behind a Marc Chagall painting. The painting was later sold to Klaus Perls and his wife by a Parisian gallery in 1955, who then sold it to Albert List the same year. In 1962, Menzel discovered the painting's location, demanded its return from List, and brought a replevin action when he refused. List impleaded the Perlses, claiming breach of implied warranty of title. The jury ruled in Menzel's favor, ordering the painting's return. List was awarded damages, initially set at $22,500.

An Antique Platter of Gold, known as a Gold Phiale Mesomphalos, 991 F. Supp. 222 (1997)\\nFacts: William Veres, a European art dealer, sold an ancient gold plate (phiale) to New York-based art dealer Robert Haber on behalf of ultimate purchaser Michael Steinhardt. Haber represented the phiale as being from Switzerland with a value of $250,000 on customs entry forms when, in reality, it was from Italy and valued at $1 million. The Italian government sought U.S. assistance in locating the phiale, leading to its seizure and forfeiture under a U.S. statute prohibiting importation through false statements. Steinhardt, claiming ownership, contested the forfeiture. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the U.S., and Steinhardt appealed, arguing that the false statements were not material.\\nIssue: Is a false statement made to customs officials material if it would naturally tend to influence the officials?', 'Judgement: The rule establishes that a false statement made to customs officials is material if it would naturally tend to influence them. Importation through a false statement is not the same as importation because of a false statement. Forfeiture of the imported item under the relevant statute requires the false statement to be integral to the importation process, though not necessarily the deciding factor. If it can be demonstrated that a false statement would be significant to a reasonable customs official, materiality is established.\\nUnited States v. Schultz, 178 F.

However, Jaspers did not use the term \"collusion\" explicitly in the way it is commonly understood today. Instead, his work laid the groundwork for understanding interpersonal dynamics and the therapist\\'s influence on the therapeutic relationship.\\nThe term \"collusion\" in psychotherapy was first introduced by Sándor Ferenczi in 1933. He described collusion as an unconscious process linking the transference reactions of the patient with the countertransference reactions of clinicians, leading to specific and often complex dynamics in the therapeutic relationship.', \"Love as test of masculinity in the phallic-oedipal collusion.\\nThe author understands the dyad as a half-open system and describes the function of third persons in the collusion conflict. For the advancement of a couple, relationships with third persons are necessary. The author restricts himself to considering only those forms, that contribute to not carry out a conflict. He describes different the roles, third persons can take and their effect on the couples' dynamic. Furthermore, he considers psychosomatic couple illness and their consequences for the collusion. A psychosomatic illness has a similar meaning as a third person. Finally, the author describes therapeutic aspects of couples therapy and their effect and application of the collusion concept.

In contemporary psychotherapeutical practice, collusion often refers to a failure of the therapist to maintain neutrality or objectivity, such as when the therapist aligns too closely with a client's distorted perspectives or defenses.

      "['philosophy is accompanied by strong theological connotations. The history of\\nnatural law is long and complex, with various schools of thought emerging at\\ndiﬀerent periods in diﬀerent parts of the world. Over the centuries, and certainly\\nby the Middle Ages, the notion of the ‘law of God’ came to replace the Aristotelian\\nconception of the ‘law of nature’ as the ultimate criterion whereby society, law and\\nhuman existence might be evaluated. One reason for this link between religion and\\nphilosophies of law and state was that, as European societies developed and the\\nstruggle between the traditional power of the Church and the new and increasing\\npolitical power of emerging nation-states and rulers became more pronounced,', 'political power of emerging nation-states and rulers became more pronounced,\\nnatural-law philosophy, which could be seen as often, though not invariably, having\\nconservative overtones (‘what is, ought to be, because nature has decreed it’), came\\nto be a useful weapon for the justiﬁcation of the existing political and social insti-\\ntutions and the resistance of radical change. In the course of this historical process,\\nover many centuries, natural-law philosophies became closely and inextricably tied\\nto morality and to religious doctrine.This connection between natural law, human law and society was crystallised\\ninto the classical formulation of natural-law theory as we know it today (despite the\\nmany guises it may take) through the writings of St Thomas Aquinas in the Middle', 'interests. Again, law may be seen as an institution for the furtherance and protection\\nof the welfare of everyone, or it may be seen, crudely, as an instrument of repression\\nwielded by the dominant groups in society.3737 P.

Buckle, ‘Philosophies of Law and the Law Teacher’ (1976) The Law Teacher, p 6.The above alternative standpoints are simpliﬁed statements of what are usually\\nextremely complicated political views and positions, but the point is that people\\ndo have very diﬀerent views as to what law, in general or with regard to speciﬁc\\nrules, is for.Within the ﬁeld of legal and social study, there may be discerned a whole range\\nof alternative or competing viewpoints about law and society, which at its simplest', 'Historical school\\nHistorical jurisprudence came to prominence during the debate on the proposed codification of German law. In his book On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence, Friedrich Carl von Savigny argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs, and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. Historicists believe that law originates with society.', \"Natural law holds that there are rational objective limits to the power of rulers, the foundations of law are accessible through reason, and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain force.\\nAnalytic jurisprudence rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be, espousing the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems. It encompasses theories such as legal positivism and legal realism.\", 'Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was based on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists.

These agencies include the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), Austrade, and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE).\"]\n",

These are precisely the kind of\\nreasons that are ruled out in any other context for determining a sound\\nmoral judgement, so they should be ruled out in the context of personal\\nmorals as well. The mere fact of a moral consensus, if it is not based on\\nreasons that will stand up to scrutiny, does not for Dworkin make it morally\\nlegitimate.One common objection to Dworkin’s argument is that it would also\\ndisqualify vast numbers of ordinary moral judgements on acts of gratuitous\\ncruelty, which an average jury member will condemn primarily on the basis\\nof angry indignation and disgust. Many statutes embody prohibitions origi-\\nnally based on this kind of popular revulsion. This is a mistaken objection,', 'many critics that there are other serious moral issues that might equally\\nmerit principled lawbreaking – issues relating to environmental dangers,\\nunjust wars or unjust taxes – which are held to be wrongs or injustices that\\nwould not be countenanced in the original position. There is also felt to be\\nsomething excessive about his justification of unjust laws that fall short of\\nthe threshold at which they create systematic structural inequality, on the\\nassumption that rational agents – veiled from knowledge of whether they\\nwould be the victims – would regard such a high threshold of toleration of\\nsuch injustices as ‘the best possible world’.

This is a mistaken objection,\\nbecause most people in this position, jury members or legislators, would be\\nable to give non-prejudiced reasons to support the emotional reaction, to\\nexplain why such acts should not be allowed.The other key feature of Dworkin’s critique of Devlin is his rejection of\\nthe democratic majoritarian argument for the right of a community to\\nimpose the moral views of one section – even if it is a very large majority –\\non the rest of the community. Drawing an analogy between ‘the ethical envi-\\nronment’ and the economic environment, he argues that just as the majority\\ndoes not have the right to gather all economic resources to itself and leave\\nthe rest to starve, it does not have the right to dominate the ethical environ-', 'See also\\nBrain in a vat\\nDemon (thought experiment)\\nKilling baby Hitler\\nShip of Theseus\\nExtraterrestrial hypothesis\\nPsychosocial hypothesis\\nInterdimensional hypothesis\\nSpace animal hypothesis\\nHollow Earth hypothesis\\nAncient aliens hypothesis\\nSilurian hypothesis\\nTime-traveler UFO hypothesis\\n\\n\\n== References ==', 'familiar context.

During the 1947 flying disc craze, Theosophists like Meade Layne suggested that flying saucers came from Earth's 'etheric plane' while Hollow Earth conspiracy theorists suggested that the UFO reports were being caused by a technological civilization beneath the surface of the Earth.  Others suggested the UFO reports might be caused by animals indigenous to Earth's atmosphere.  In the mid 20th-century, authors like Morris Jessup and Erich von Däniken suggested extra-terrestrials might have arrived on Earth in pre-historic times, a possibility depicted in the 1969 Kubrick film 2001: A Space Odyssey.

(1981) differentiate between two forms of belief congruence theory: a \"strong\" version and a \"weak\" version. The \"strong\" version posits that discrimination is entirely based on belief congruence. Conversely, the \"weak\" version suggests that belief congruence accounts for a larger portion of discrimination variance than do perceived physical differences. While belief congruence plays a crucial role in contexts free from strong social pressures, its influence does not negate the impact of racial or ethnic differences. It\\'s also important to note that as the impact of race diminishes, the distinction between the strong and weak versions of the theory becomes progressively less relevant for immediate practical purposes.', \"'Weak version' of belief congruence theory\\nAccording to Milton Rokeach's personal communication in 1981, his intent was to advocate the strong version of the theory, that belief systems are the only factors that need to be considered when analysing prejudice and discrimination. Nonetheless, most studies about this theory are lack of significance tests between belief and race effects, but still show a common trend: beliefs more strongly influence liking and evaluations, while race impacts decisions on intimate connections.\"]\n",

These principles are rooted in conceptions of morality (of which\\nthe notion of justice is one of the most important), and the way in which these\\nmoral principles are incorporated into the law may best be appreciated by means\\nof the criminal law examples cited above. It will be noted that before a person can\\nbe convicted of theft, it must be established not only that the accused person\\n‘appropriated property belonging to another’, but also that this appropriation took\\nplace ‘with the intention of depriving the other of it’. Again, a conviction for\\nmurder can occur only if it is established not simply that the accused brought about', 'of alternative or competing viewpoints about law and society, which at its simplest\\nmay be presented as debates as to whether our society and its legal system are rep-\\nresentations or reﬂections of social consensus or social conﬂict. The former position\\nperceives law as protecting social values to which everyone subscribes; the latter\\nholds that there is no such single, universally agreed set of social values, but rather\\na whole variety of diﬀerent social values, certain of which are protected by a less-\\nthan-neutral legal system in order to protect some interests as against others.One important sociologist adhering to the ‘consensus’ view of society was\\nTalcott Parsons. His view of society as a ‘system’ comprising actions and institu-', 'tion, of which the best known is perhaps the argument presented by Lord Devlin,\\nwriting extra-judicially in 1959 about the enforcement of morality through the law.\\nCriticising the Wolfenden Report, Lord Devlin had this to say:Societies disintegrate from within more frequently than they are broken up by exter-\\nnal pressures. There is disintegration when no common morality is observed and\\nhistory shows that the loosening of moral bonds is often the ﬁrst stage of disintegra-\\ntion, so that society is justiﬁed in taking the same steps to preserve its moral code as it\\ndoes to preserve its government . . . the suppression of vice is as much the law’s busi-\\nness as the suppression of subversive activities.52Devlin’s views were, in turn, responded to by Hart,53 who relied heavily upon the', \"Legal positivism is the view that the content of law is dependent on social facts and that a legal system's existence is not constrained by morality. Within legal positivism, theorists agree that law's content is a product of social facts, but theorists disagree whether law's validity can be explained by incorporating moral values. Legal positivists who argue against the incorporation of moral values to explain law's validity are labeled exclusive (or hard) legal positivists. Joseph Raz's legal positivism is an example of exclusive legal positivism. Legal positivists who argue that law's validity can be explained by incorporating moral values are labeled inclusive (or soft) legal positivists. The legal positivist theories of H. L. A. Hart and Jules Coleman are examples of inclusive legal\", 'than to jurisprudence. Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that held that there was \"no necessary connection\" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists—including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green—reject that view. Raz claims it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).', 'American legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin\\'s legal theory attacks legal positivists that separate law\\'s content from morality. In his book Law\\'s Empire, Dworkin argued that law is an \"interpretive\" concept that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the best moral justification for the institutional facts and practices that form a society\\'s legal tradition. It follows from Dworkin\\'s view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some truths about the moral justifications of the social and political practices of that society. It is consistent with Dworkin\\'s']\n",
