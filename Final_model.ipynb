Monitoring the integrative complexity of American and Soviet policy', 'Introduction\\nKarl Jaspers introduced ideas relevant to collusion in his seminal work General Psychopathology (Allgemeine Psychopathologie), first published in 1913. However, Jaspers did not use the term \"collusion\" explicitly in the way it is commonly understood today. Instead, his work laid the groundwork for understanding interpersonal dynamics and the therapist\\'s influence on the therapeutic relationship.\\nThe term \"collusion\" in psychotherapy was first introduced by Sándor Ferenczi in 1933. He described collusion as an unconscious process linking the transference reactions of the patient with the countertransference reactions of clinicians, leading to specific and often complex dynamics in the therapeutic relationship.', 'Oral collusion\\nIn the oral collusion one partner takes the role of the caretaker and one partner takes the role of the fosterling. Because the couple is committed to their roles, the conflict develops, where the caretaker perceives the fosterling to be insatiable and ungrateful and the caretaker is perceived accusing and dismissive by the fosterling. The fosterling often reacts depressive. Basically, both partners agree, that the meaning of love is to take care of each other. Their joint resistance, the common fear directs against the idea, that the fosterling must take nursing tasks towards the caretaker. Counseling can help the couple to practice their roles and to reflect experiences and resistances.', \"The concept of collusion in couples' relations with two partners is a psychological term for behavioral patterns in relationships for couples therapy. In contemporary psychotherapeutical practice, collusion often refers to a failure of the therapist to maintain neutrality or objectivity, such as when the therapist aligns too closely with a client's distorted perspectives or defenses. It highlights the importance of self-awareness and reflective practice for the therapist.\"]\n",

      "\n",
      "The context does not provide specific information about the ethical responsibility of a psychologist in meeting with a 10-year-old child for counseling in a school setting. However, based on the general principles of ethics in psychology, the best way for the psychologist to meet the prescribed ethical responsibility would be to obtain both written consent from the parent(s) and verbal assent from the child. This is because the child may not fully understand the implications of therapy and may not be able to provide informed consent. Therefore, the psychologist should ensure that the parent(s) understand the nature of the therapy and provide written consent, while also obtaining the child's assent verbally to ensure that the child is willing to participate in the therapy.\n",

List 49, Misc. 2d 300 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1966)\\nFacts: Erna Menzel and her husband fled Belgium in 1940 during the German invasion, leaving behind a Marc Chagall painting. The painting was later sold to Klaus Perls and his wife by a Parisian gallery in 1955, who then sold it to Albert List the same year. In 1962, Menzel discovered the painting's location, demanded its return from List, and brought a replevin action when he refused.

An Antique Platter of Gold, known as a Gold Phiale Mesomphalos, 991 F. Supp. 222 (1997)\\nFacts: William Veres, a European art dealer, sold an ancient gold plate (phiale) to New York-based art dealer Robert Haber on behalf of ultimate purchaser Michael Steinhardt. Haber represented the phiale as being from Switzerland with a value of $250,000 on customs entry forms when, in reality, it was from Italy and valued at $1 million. The Italian government sought U.S. assistance in locating the phiale, leading to its seizure and forfeiture under a U.S. statute prohibiting importation through false statements. Steinhardt, claiming ownership, contested the forfeiture. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the U.S., and Steinhardt appealed, arguing that the false statements were not material.\\nIssue: Is a false statement made to customs officials material if it would naturally tend to influence the officials?', 'Judgement: The rule establishes that a false statement made to customs officials is material if it would naturally tend to influence them. Importation through a false statement is not the same as importation because of a false statement. Forfeiture of the imported item under the relevant statute requires the false statement to be integral to the importation process, though not necessarily the deciding factor. If it can be demonstrated that a false statement would be significant to a reasonable customs official, materiality is established.\\nUnited States v. Schultz, 178 F.

One of\\nhis main complaints about Devlin’s case against liberty is that he blurs the\\ndistinction between paternalist law and what Hart now labels ‘legal\\nmoralism’. This is the distinction between laws for the protection of people\\nagainst themselves and laws that merely seek to enforce moral standards.

If\\nbehaviour deemed to be immoral is widely regarded as by definition harmful\\nand self-destructive, laws prohibiting it will be seen as paternalistic and\\ndefensible. With this distinction now drawn clearly, however, it becomes a\\nquestion of whether – as Devlin argues – society does in fact have the right\\nto condemn actions as inherently immoral and to punish them solely as\\nsuch, irrespective of their effects on others.The question of whether society has such a right is a normative one. For\\nHart, employing Bentham’s distinction, it is a question of critical rather\\nthan positive morality, and of normative rather than descriptive jurispru-\\ndence. It is not a question of determining whether this right already exists in', 'contract would agree to accepting the duty to obey, because each individu-\\nally would expect to flourish under such arrangements. This natural duty, he\\nargues, would be endorsed in preference to a principle of utility, because the\\nlatter is based not on rational self-interest, but on a calculation of what\\nwould be best for the aggregate welfare of all the citizens.The more important question for Rawls is that of whether there can be a\\nduty to comply with an unjust law, or with unjust social arrangements. From\\nthe outset, Rawls rejects the idea that the duty to obey can be restricted to\\nperfectly just laws and institutions. This, he says, is as mistaken as regarding\\nthe legal validity of a law as a sufficient reason for obeying it. Clearly, in the', 'Kant provided several formulations of the categorical imperative. One formulation says that a person should only follow maxims that can be universalized. This means that the person would want everyone to follow the same maxim as a universal law applicable to everyone. Another formulation states that one should treat other people always as ends in themselves and never as mere means to an end. This formulation focuses on respecting and valuing other people for their own sake rather than using them in the pursuit of personal goals.\\nIn either case, Kant says that what matters is to have a good will. A person has a good will if they respect the moral law and form their intentions and motives in agreement with it. Kant states that actions motivated in such a way are unconditionally good, meaning that they are good even in cases where they result in undesirable consequences.', 'Kantianism\\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) is one of the most well-known deontologists. He states that reaching outcomes that people desire, such as being happy, is not the main purpose of moral actions. Instead, he argues that there are universal principles that apply to everyone independent of their desires. He uses the term categorical imperative for these principles, saying that they have their source in the structure of practical reason and are true for all rational agents. According to Kant, to act morally is to act in agreement with reason as expressed by these principles while violating them is both immoral and irrational.', \"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) saw Kant's categorical imperative on its own as an empty formalism and emphasized the role of social institutions in providing concrete content to moral duties. According to the Christian philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), the demands of ethical duties are sometimes suspended when doing God's will. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) formulated criticisms of both Christian and Kantian morality. Another influential development in this period was the formulation of utilitarianism by Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). According to the utilitarian doctrine, actions should promote happiness while reducing suffering and the right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\"]\n",

      "['philosophy is accompanied by strong theological connotations. The history of\\nnatural law is long and complex, with various schools of thought emerging at\\ndiﬀerent periods in diﬀerent parts of the world. Over the centuries, and certainly\\nby the Middle Ages, the notion of the ‘law of God’ came to replace the Aristotelian\\nconception of the ‘law of nature’ as the ultimate criterion whereby society, law and\\nhuman existence might be evaluated. One reason for this link between religion and\\nphilosophies of law and state was that, as European societies developed and the\\nstruggle between the traditional power of the Church and the new and increasing\\npolitical power of emerging nation-states and rulers became more pronounced,', 'political power of emerging nation-states and rulers became more pronounced,\\nnatural-law philosophy, which could be seen as often, though not invariably, having\\nconservative overtones (‘what is, ought to be, because nature has decreed it’), came\\nto be a useful weapon for the justiﬁcation of the existing political and social insti-\\ntutions and the resistance of radical change. In the course of this historical process,\\nover many centuries, natural-law philosophies became closely and inextricably tied\\nto morality and to religious doctrine.This connection between natural law, human law and society was crystallised\\ninto the classical formulation of natural-law theory as we know it today (despite the\\nmany guises it may take) through the writings of St Thomas Aquinas in the Middle', 'interests. Again, law may be seen as an institution for the furtherance and protection\\nof the welfare of everyone, or it may be seen, crudely, as an instrument of repression\\nwielded by the dominant groups in society.3737 P. J. Harris and J. D. Buckle, ‘Philosophies of Law and the Law Teacher’ (1976) The Law Teacher, p 6.The above alternative standpoints are simpliﬁed statements of what are usually\\nextremely complicated political views and positions, but the point is that people\\ndo have very diﬀerent views as to what law, in general or with regard to speciﬁc\\nrules, is for.Within the ﬁeld of legal and social study, there may be discerned a whole range\\nof alternative or competing viewpoints about law and society, which at its simplest', 'Historical school\\nHistorical jurisprudence came to prominence during the debate on the proposed codification of German law. In his book On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence, Friedrich Carl von Savigny argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs, and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. Historicists believe that law originates with society.', \"Natural law holds that there are rational objective limits to the power of rulers, the foundations of law are accessible through reason, and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain force.\\nAnalytic jurisprudence rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be, espousing the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems. It encompasses theories such as legal positivism and legal realism.\", 'Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was based on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists.

      "['tages claimed for the doctrine is that the judges have the freedom, or at least the\\ndiscretion, to treat precedents with some ﬂexibility.The ﬁrst such mechanism is inherent in the court structure itself: a court is free\\nto overrule a decision of a court lower than itself, if it is of the opinion that the pre-\\nvious case was wrongly decided or has become out of date. Hence the Court of\\nAppeal may overrule a decision of the High Court, and the House of Lords may\\noverrule a decision of the Court of Appeal – and sometimes a previous decision of\\nits own. Another device whereby precedents may be avoided (open to all courts\\nirrespective of their place in the hierarchy) is known as distinguishing on the facts.', 'tal’ or ‘human’ rights which may have signiﬁcance in the application of European\\nCommunity law. In J Nold v Commission46 the court stated that it was ‘bound to draw\\ninspiration from constitutional traditions common to the member states, and it\\ncannot therefore uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights\\nrecognised and protected by . . . those states. Similarly, international treaties for the\\nprotection of human rights on which the member states have collaborated or of\\nwhich they are signatories, can supply guidelines which should be followed.’Given these principles, we need to outline the nature and scope of European\\nCommunity policy.

      "['‘intolerance, indignation and disgust’. These are precisely the kind of\\nreasons that are ruled out in any other context for determining a sound\\nmoral judgement, so they should be ruled out in the context of personal\\nmorals as well. The mere fact of a moral consensus, if it is not based on\\nreasons that will stand up to scrutiny, does not for Dworkin make it morally\\nlegitimate.One common objection to Dworkin’s argument is that it would also\\ndisqualify vast numbers of ordinary moral judgements on acts of gratuitous\\ncruelty, which an average jury member will condemn primarily on the basis\\nof angry indignation and disgust. Many statutes embody prohibitions origi-\\nnally based on this kind of popular revulsion. This is a mistaken objection,', 'many critics that there are other serious moral issues that might equally\\nmerit principled lawbreaking – issues relating to environmental dangers,\\nunjust wars or unjust taxes – which are held to be wrongs or injustices that\\nwould not be countenanced in the original position. There is also felt to be\\nsomething excessive about his justification of unjust laws that fall short of\\nthe threshold at which they create systematic structural inequality, on the\\nassumption that rational agents – veiled from knowledge of whether they\\nwould be the victims – would regard such a high threshold of toleration of\\nsuch injustices as ‘the best possible world’. The objection here is either that\\nthis is not what we would agree to from behind the veil, any more than we', 'nally based on this kind of popular revulsion. This is a mistaken objection,\\nbecause most people in this position, jury members or legislators, would be\\nable to give non-prejudiced reasons to support the emotional reaction, to\\nexplain why such acts should not be allowed.The other key feature of Dworkin’s critique of Devlin is his rejection of\\nthe democratic majoritarian argument for the right of a community to\\nimpose the moral views of one section – even if it is a very large majority –\\non the rest of the community. Drawing an analogy between ‘the ethical envi-\\nronment’ and the economic environment, he argues that just as the majority\\ndoes not have the right to gather all economic resources to itself and leave\\nthe rest to starve, it does not have the right to dominate the ethical environ-', \"Agent-centered deontological theories focus on the person who acts and the duties they have. Agent-centered theories often focus on the motives and intentions behind people's actions, highlighting the importance of acting for the right reasons. They tend to be agent-relative, meaning that the reasons for which people should act depend on personal circumstances. For example, a parent has a special obligation to their child, while a stranger does not have this kind of obligation toward a child they do not know. Patient-centered theories, by contrast, focus on the people affected by actions and the rights they have. An example is the requirement to treat other people as ends and not merely as a means to an end. This requirement can be used to argue, for example, that it is wrong to kill a person against their will even if this act would save the lives of several others. Patient-centered deontological theories are usually agent-neutral, meaning that they apply equally to everyone in a\", 'A further difference is between maximizing and satisficing consequentialism. According to maximizing consequentialism, only the best possible act is morally permitted. This means that acts with positive consequences are wrong if there are alternatives with even better consequences. One criticism of maximizing consequentialism is that it demands too much by requiring that people do significantly more than they are socially expected to. For example, if the best action for someone with a good salary would be to donate 70% of their income to charity, it would be morally wrong for them to only donate 65%. Satisficing consequentialism, by contrast, only requires that an act is \"good enough\" even if it is not the best possible alternative. According to this view, it is possible to do more than one is morally required to do.', 'Contractualists reject the reference to God as the source of morality and argue instead that morality is based on an explicit or implicit social contract between humans. They state that actual or hypothetical consent to this contract is the source of moral norms and duties. To determine which duties people have, contractualists often rely on a thought experiment about what rational people under ideal circumstances would agree on. For example, if they would agree that people should not lie then there is a moral obligation to refrain from lying. Because it relies on consent, contractualism is often understood as a patient-centered form of deontology. Famous social contract theorists include Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and John Rawls.']\n",

      "['utility. A specific law, for example, is good or bad to the extent that it\\nproduces on balance more happiness than unhappiness, which Bentham\\nmeasured in terms of pleasure and the absence of pain. On this way of\\nthinking, the role of reason changes. It cannot distinguish just from unjust\\ndealings without reference to consequences in terms of human welfare. The\\nrole of reason is removed from its central place in natural law theory and\\nreduced to that of rationally calculating the external consequences of\\nactions and laws in terms of the aggregate good that will come out of them.Bentham had many specific complaints about common law theory and its\\npractice, which was closely tied to the traditional natural law theories. He', 'is easy to see how this distinction can be blurred and the issue confused. If\\nbehaviour deemed to be immoral is widely regarded as by definition harmful\\nand self-destructive, laws prohibiting it will be seen as paternalistic and\\ndefensible. With this distinction now drawn clearly, however, it becomes a\\nquestion of whether – as Devlin argues – society does in fact have the right\\nto condemn actions as inherently immoral and to punish them solely as\\nsuch, irrespective of their effects on others.The question of whether society has such a right is a normative one. For\\nHart, employing Bentham’s distinction, it is a question of critical rather\\nthan positive morality, and of normative rather than descriptive jurispru-\\ndence. It is not a question of determining whether this right already exists in', 'recognised, there is no alternative but to hand it over. If it were merely\\ndesert, one might argue that there are more deserving claims. If it were\\nmerely need, it might be argued that there were others in greater need. Given\\nthat it is a right, she can demand it in a way that others cannot.Absolute rightsIt is very commonly argued against rights-based moralities that, for a right\\nto have any force at all, it must be regarded as absolute. Rights must be either\\nsubordinate to utility or they must be held to be completely inviolable. Either\\nway, they are absolute and unyielding, or there is no way of stopping them\\ndissolving into utility. Jonathan Glover, for example (1977: 83{-}4) argues\\nthat anything short of a defence of absolute rights, falling back on a theory', 'Utilitarianism\\nThe most well-known form of consequentialism is utilitarianism. In its classical form, it is an act consequentialism that sees happiness as the only source of intrinsic value. This means that an act is morally right if it produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number\" by increasing happiness and reducing suffering. Utilitarians do not deny that other things also have value, like health, friendship, and knowledge. However, they deny that these things have intrinsic value. Instead, they say that they have extrinsic value because they affect happiness and suffering. In this regard, they are desirable as a means but, unlike happiness, not as an end. The view that pleasure is the only thing with intrinsic value is called ethical or evaluative hedonism.', 'Consequentialism\\nConsequentialism, also called teleological ethics, says that morality depends on consequences. According to the most common view, an act is right if it brings the best future. This means that there is no alternative course of action that has better consequences. A key aspect of consequentialist theories is that they provide a characterization of what is good and then define what is right in terms of what is good. For example, classical utilitarianism says that pleasure is good and that the action leading to the most overall pleasure is right. Consequentialism has been discussed indirectly since the formulation of classical utilitarianism in the late 18th century. A more explicit analysis of this view happened in the 20th century, when the term was coined by G. E. M. Anscombe.', 'A further difference is between maximizing and satisficing consequentialism. According to maximizing consequentialism, only the best possible act is morally permitted. This means that acts with positive consequences are wrong if there are alternatives with even better consequences. One criticism of maximizing consequentialism is that it demands too much by requiring that people do significantly more than they are socially expected to. For example, if the best action for someone with a good salary would be to donate 70% of their income to charity, it would be morally wrong for them to only donate 65%. Satisficing consequentialism, by contrast, only requires that an act is \"good enough\" even if it is not the best possible alternative. According to this view, it is possible to do more than one is morally required to do.']\n",

With the arrival of night-active mammals, smell replaced vision as the dominant sense, and a different way of responding arose from the olfactory sense, which is proposed to have developed into mammalian emotion and emotional memory. The mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept – one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles. These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.', 'In the five million years since the lineages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system. Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOXP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language. Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans. Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the', \"More contemporary views along the evolutionary psychology spectrum posit that both basic emotions and social emotions evolved to motivate (social) behaviors that were adaptive in the ancestral environment. Emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems. Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on one hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand. The increased potential in neuroimaging has also allowed investigation into evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain. Important neurological advances were derived from these perspectives in the 1990s by Joseph E. LeDoux and Antonio Damasio. For example, in an extensive study of a subject with ventromedial frontal lobe damage described in the book Descartes' Error, Damasio demonstrated how loss of physiological capacity for emotion resulted in the subject's lost capacity to make\"]\n",

Autonomous motivation is associated with acting according to one's free will or doing something because one wants to do it. In the case of controlled motivation, the person feels pressured into doing something by external forces.\\nA related contrast is between push and pull motivation. Push motivation arises from unfulfilled internal needs and aims at satisfying them. For example, hunger may push an individual to find something to eat. Pull motivation arises from an external goal and aims at achieving this goal, like the motivation to get a university degree.\", \"The strength of a motivational state also affects whether it is translated into action. One theory states that different motivational states compete with each other and that only the behavior with the highest net force of motivation is put into action. However, it is controversial whether this is always true. For example, it has been suggested that in cases of rational deliberation, it may be possible to act against one's strongest motive. Another problem is that this view may lead to a form of determinism that denies the existence of free will.\", 'Many types of motivation are discussed in the academic literature. Intrinsic motivation comes from internal factors like enjoyment and curiosity. It contrasts with extrinsic motivation, which is driven by external factors like obtaining rewards and avoiding punishment. For conscious motivation, the individual is aware of the motive driving the behavior, which is not the case for unconscious motivation. Other types include rational and irrational motivation, biological and cognitive motivation, short-term and long-term motivation, and egoistic and altruistic motivation.']\n",

These principles are rooted in conceptions of morality (of which\\nthe notion of justice is one of the most important), and the way in which these\\nmoral principles are incorporated into the law may best be appreciated by means\\nof the criminal law examples cited above. It will be noted that before a person can\\nbe convicted of theft, it must be established not only that the accused person\\n‘appropriated property belonging to another’, but also that this appropriation took\\nplace ‘with the intention of depriving the other of it’. Again, a conviction for\\nmurder can occur only if it is established not simply that the accused brought about', 'of alternative or competing viewpoints about law and society, which at its simplest\\nmay be presented as debates as to whether our society and its legal system are rep-\\nresentations or reﬂections of social consensus or social conﬂict. The former position\\nperceives law as protecting social values to which everyone subscribes; the latter\\nholds that there is no such single, universally agreed set of social values, but rather\\na whole variety of diﬀerent social values, certain of which are protected by a less-\\nthan-neutral legal system in order to protect some interests as against others.One important sociologist adhering to the ‘consensus’ view of society was\\nTalcott Parsons. His view of society as a ‘system’ comprising actions and institu-', 'tion, of which the best known is perhaps the argument presented by Lord Devlin,\\nwriting extra-judicially in 1959 about the enforcement of morality through the law.\\nCriticising the Wolfenden Report, Lord Devlin had this to say:Societies disintegrate from within more frequently than they are broken up by exter-\\nnal pressures. There is disintegration when no common morality is observed and\\nhistory shows that the loosening of moral bonds is often the ﬁrst stage of disintegra-\\ntion, so that society is justiﬁed in taking the same steps to preserve its moral code as it\\ndoes to preserve its government . . . the suppression of vice is as much the law’s busi-\\nness as the suppression of subversive activities.52Devlin’s views were, in turn, responded to by Hart,53 who relied heavily upon the', \"Legal positivism is the view that the content of law is dependent on social facts and that a legal system's existence is not constrained by morality. Within legal positivism, theorists agree that law's content is a product of social facts, but theorists disagree whether law's validity can be explained by incorporating moral values. Legal positivists who argue against the incorporation of moral values to explain law's validity are labeled exclusive (or hard) legal positivists. Joseph Raz's legal positivism is an example of exclusive legal positivism. Legal positivists who argue that law's validity can be explained by incorporating moral values are labeled inclusive (or soft) legal positivists. The legal positivist theories of H. L. A. Hart and Jules Coleman are examples of inclusive legal\", 'than to jurisprudence. Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that held that there was \"no necessary connection\" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists—including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green—reject that view. Raz claims it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).', 'American legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin\\'s legal theory attacks legal positivists that separate law\\'s content from morality. In his book Law\\'s Empire, Dworkin argued that law is an \"interpretive\" concept that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the best moral justification for the institutional facts and practices that form a society\\'s legal tradition. It follows from Dworkin\\'s view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some truths about the moral justifications of the social and political practices of that society. It is consistent with Dworkin\\'s']\n",
